</div>
<hr class="r15">

<p>During the last twenty-five years my work in verse has been mainly
confined to illustrating the history of the United States, with occasional
studies of local life and character. Of this, judging by notices of the
press, and their appearance in compilations of a patriotic or martial
nature, the metrical narratives of battles seem to have been most approved;
and it occurred to me that a volume embracing my productions
in that line of literary labor might meet with popular favor. My
first intention was to take up every notable event, so that the book
might be a complete metrical history, and I prepared partly the matter
for the purpose, including the capture of the <em>Serapis</em> and the achievements
of <em>Old Ironsides</em>. But I found the volume would be inconveniently
large, and I abandoned my plan reluctantly.</p>

<p>The historical sketches prefixed in the proper places will be found
full, unless the details are faithfully given in the text, when the introductions
are purposely made meagre. In either case they will be found
to be accurate, the verses being, as I have styled them, “metrical narratives”
rather than poems. In that form, I trust, they more readily
impress on the mind of the reader a sense of the patriotism and courage
of our forefathers, and give a notion of the nature of the struggle
by which these States emerged from a dependent condition to take
high rank among the peoples of the world. The story of each event
being told in the first person, the style and language are intentionally
marked by the peculiarities of the imaginary narrator. And in this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</span>
connection it will be observed that, because of the nearness of the
conflict, the battles of the late sectional war have been avoided, and
the two incidents of that period touched on at the close are personal,
and not likely to offend even the most sensitive.</p>

</figure>

<p>Hernando de Soto was of good Spanish family, and started early upon a career of adventure.
He was with Francisco Pizarro, and took a prominent part in the conquest of Peru. Some
account of his actions while with the Pizarros will be found in Helps’s “Spanish Conquest in
America.” He particularly distinguished himself in the battle which resulted in the conquest
of Cuzco, and desired to be the lieutenant of Almagro in the invasion of Chili; but in this he
was disappointed. Returning to Spain with
much wealth, he married into the Bobadilla
family, and became a favorite with the king.
Here he conceived the notion of conquering
Florida, which he believed to abound in gold
and precious stones. Offering to do this at
his own expense, the king gave him permission,
and at the same time appointed him
governor of Cuba. De Soto set sail from
Spain in April, 1538, but remained in Cuba
some time fitting out his expedition, which
did not arrive at Florida until the following
year, when it landed at Tampa Bay. His
force consisted of twelve hundred men, with
four hundred horses, and he took with him a
number of domestic animals. In quest of
gold, he penetrated the territory now known
as the States of Alabama, Georgia, Tennessee,
and Mississippi, finally striking the Mississippi
River, which he called the Rio Grande,
at or near the Lower Chickasaw Bluffs. He
found the inhabitants to be quite unlike the
Peruvians. He met with a fierce resistance
from the natives, and by severe hardships
and bloody conflicts found his army very
much reduced in numbers. In 1542 De Soto died of a fever. To prevent the mutilation of his
body, it was enclosed in a coffin hollowed from the trunk of a tree, and sunk at midnight in the
great river. The command then devolved on Moscoso, who escaped with his comrades by way
of the river, and reached Mexico in a miserable condition.</p>

<p>It was during this raid, on the 18th of October, 1539, that the battle with the Mobilians was
fought. The incidents, so far as they have been gathered from all sources, are faithfully given<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>
in the ballad, with one exception. The speech of Tuscaloosa was in the shape of a message, and
was delivered by one of his men after the chief had escaped and found refuge in his “palace,”
which was probably a hut more commodious than the others in the town. The Spaniards, in
spite of their superiority of weapons, had much the worst of the affair at one time, and might
have been disastrously defeated but for the opportune arrival of Moscoso with the reserve of
four hundred fresh men. After that the battle changed to a mere massacre.</p>

<p>The “singing women” described in the text must have been picked Amazons, for the women
in general, and children, had been previously sent to a place of refuge by the Mobilians in anticipation
of a fight. The slaughter of the poorly armed natives was very great, but the invaders
suffered severely. Not only were eighty-two killed, including the nephew and nephew-in-law
of the Adelantado (as De Soto was styled), but none of the Spaniards escaped severe wounds.
To add to their sufferings, the medicines and surgical appliances, having been placed in the
town previous to the breaking out of the conflict, were burned, and all the surgeons but one
were killed. De Soto himself received an arrow in his thigh. The missile was not extracted
until after the battle, and he was forced to continue the fight standing in his stirrups.</p>

<p>The place of the battle is supposed to be what is now known as Choctaw Bluff, in Clarke
County, Alabama.</p>

<p>Not an hour’s ride from Williamsburg, the seat of the venerable William and Mary College,
lie the ruins of Jamestown—part of the tower of the old brick church, piles of bricks, and a
number of tombstones with quaint inscriptions, all half overgrown by copse and brambles,
being all that remains of the first town of Virginia. At the time of its destruction it could not
have been a considerable place. It had the church, a state-house, and a few dwellings built of
imported bricks, not more than eighteen in number, if so many. The other houses were probably
framed, with some log-huts. Our accounts of the place are meagre, and derived from different
sources.</p>

<p>Nor have we a very full account of the circumstances attending its destruction. So far as
they are gathered they amount to this: Sir William Berkeley, who at the outset of his administration
had been a good governor, was displaced during the troubles at home, and when he
returned, had been soured, and proved to be exacting and tyrannical. Refusing to allow a force
to be led against the Indian enemy, the people took it in their own hands. Berkeley had a show
of right in the matter. Indian chiefs had come to John Washington, the great-grandfather of
George Washington, to treat of peace. Washington was colonel of Westmoreland County, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
he had these messengers killed. Berkeley was indignant. “They came in peace,” said he, “and
I would have sent them in peace if they had killed my father and mother.” The bloody act
aroused the vengeance of the Indians, and they fell on the frontier and massacred men, women,
and children. The governor considered it a just retribution, and refused authority for reprisals.
The people, who had no notion that innocent parties should suffer for one man’s barbarous-deed,
organized. They chose Nathaniel Bacon, who was a popular young lawyer, for their leader,
and asked Berkeley to confirm him. This request was refused. When some new murders by
the Indians occurred, Bacon marched against the enemy, and the governor proclaimed him and
his men rebels. When Bacon returned in triumph he was elected a member of the assembly
from Henrico County, and that assembly passed laws of such a popular nature that Berkeley, in
alarm, left Jamestown. Bacon raised a force of five hundred men, and Berkeley, who possessed
high personal courage, met them alone. He uncovered his breast and said, “A fair mark.
Shoot!” But when Bacon explained that he merely asked a commission, the people being in
peril from the enemy, this was granted; but no sooner had Bacon departed to attack the Indians
than Berkeley withdrew to the Eastern Shore, where he collected a force of a thousand men from
Accomac, to whom he offered pay and plunder. With these he returned to Jamestown, and proclaimed
Bacon and his adherents rebels and traitors.</p>

<p>Bacon, having severely chastised the Indians, returned; but only a few of his followers remained.
This was in September, 1676. He laid regular siege to Jamestown; but, as his force
was so weak, he feared a sortie by overwhelming numbers. To avert this, and gain time to complete
his works, he resorted to stratagem. By means of a picked party, sent at night, he captured
the wives of the leading inhabitants. These, the next day, he placed on the summit of a small
work in sight of the town, and kept them thus exposed until he had completed his lines, when he
released them. Berkeley sallied out, and was repulsed. He could not depend on his own men,
and that night he retired in his vessels. Bacon entered the town next morning, and after consultation,
it was agreed to destroy the place. At seven o’clock in the evening, the torch was
applied, and in the morning the tower of the church and a few chimneys were all that were left
standing.</p>

<p>A number of Berkeley’s men now joined Bacon, who was undisputed master of the colony; but
dying shortly after, his party dispersed. Berkeley, reinstated, took signal vengeance and executed
about twenty of the most prominent of Bacon’s friends. He was only stopped by the positive
orders of the King, by whom he was removed, and Lord Culpepper, almost as great a tyrant, sent
in his room.</p>

</div>


<div class="blockquot">

<p>In 1703, Colonel Johannis Schuyler, grandfather of the Revolutionary general, Philip
Schuyler, and uncle of the still more famous Peter Schuyler, so distinguished in the Franco-Canadian
war, was mayor of Albany. From some Indians trading there he obtained information
that an attack on Deerfield was planned from Canada. He sent word to the villagers, who prepared
to meet it. The design not having been carried out that summer, the people of Deerfield
supposed it to have been abandoned, and dismissed their fears. The next year Vaudreuil, the
governor of Canada, despatched a force of three hundred French and Indians against the place.
The expedition was under the command of Hertel de Rouville, the son of an almost equally
famous partisan officer. With him were four of his brothers. The raiders came by way of Lake
Champlain to the Onion River—then called the French—up which they advanced, and passed on,
marching on the ice, until they were near Deerfield. The minister of the place, the Rev. Mr.
Williams, unlike the rest of the townsmen, had feared an attack for some time, and on his application
the provincial government had sent a guard of twenty men. There were two or three
block-houses, and around these some palisades. De Rouville came near the town before daylight
on the 29th of February, and learned by his spies the condition of the place. Finding that the
sentinels had gone to sleep two hours before dawn, and that the snow had drifted in one place
so as to cover the palisades, he led a rush, and then dispersed his men in small parties through
the town to make a simultaneous attack.
The place was carried, with the exception
of one garrison-house which held out successfully.
Forty-seven of the inhabitants
were killed, and nearly all the rest captured.
The enemy, failing to reduce the single
block-house, retreated with their prisoners,
taking up their march for Canada. A
band of colonists was hurriedly raised,
and pursued De Rouville; but they were
beaten off after a sharp fight. A hundred
and twelve prisoners were carried away.
A few were killed on the march; the
greater part were ransomed, and returned
in about two years.</p>

<p>Among the prisoners was the Rev. Mr.
Williams. His wife, unable to keep up
with the party, was killed on the second
day by her captor. Two of his children
had been killed during the sack. One of
his daughters, Eunice, while in captivity
was converted to the Catholic religion,
and married with an Indian. She entirely
adopted Indian habits, and was pleased
with her life. Afterwards she occasionally
visited her friends in New England,
but no persuasion would induce her to remain there. A chronicler states, with a comical
mixture of surprise and indignation, “She uniformly persisted in wearing her blankets and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
counting her beads.” One of her descendants was a highly respected clergyman, the Rev.
Eleazer Williams, who died a few years since, and who during life became the subject of controversy.
Mr. Hansen wrote an article, and finally a book, “The Lost Prince,” to prove that
Mr. Williams was really the missing Dauphin, Louis the Sixteenth. A look at the clergyman’s
portrait shows the half-breed features quite distinctly, though the claim was plausibly put, and
for a time had its ardent supporters.</p>

  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">High against the palisadoes, on the meadows, banks, and hill-sides,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">At the rill-sides, over fences, lay the lingering winter snow;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And so high by tempest rifted, at our pickets it was drifted,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">That its frozen crust was chosen as a bridge to bear the foe.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">We had set at night a sentry, lest an entry, while the sombre</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Heavy slumber was upon us, by the Frenchman should be made;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But the faithless knave we posted, though of wakefulness he boasted,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">’Stead of keeping watch was sleeping, and his solemn trust betrayed.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Than our slumber none profounder; never sounder fell on sleeper,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Never deeper sleep its shadow cast on dull and listless frames;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But it fled before the crashing of the portals, and the flashing,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And the soaring, and the roaring, and the crackling of the flames.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Fell the shining hatchets quickly ’mid the thickly crowded women,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Growing dim in crimson currents from the pulses of the brain;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Rained the balls from firelocks deadly, till the melted snow ran redly</div>

  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">I, from pleasant dreams awaking at the breaking of my casement,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">With amazement saw the foemen quickly enter where I lay;</div>

    <div class="verse indent2">Heard their groaning and their moaning as their spirits passed away.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">’Twas in vain I struggled madly as the sadly sounding pleading</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">’Twas in vain I wrestled, raging, fight against their numbers waging,</div>

  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">At the spot to which they bore me, no one o’er me watched or warded;</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Watching by the firelight ruddy, as the butchers dark and bloody</div>

  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Naught knew I how came they thither, nor from whither; naught to me then</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Quickly drawn o’er axe-edge lightly, cords were cut that held me tightly,</div>

  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Oh, what anger dark, consuming, fearful, glooming, looming horrid,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Huge he was, and brave and brawny, but I met the slayer tawny,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And with rigorous blow, and vigorous, clove his tufted skull in twain—</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Madly dashing down the crashing bloody hatchet in his brain.</div>
  </div>

<p>The Lewis family seem to have occupied a position as prominent, and to have been as much
identified with the local history of the Colony of Virginia, as the Schuyler family with New York
and New Jersey. The John Lewis who is the hero of the ballad, though less known than Andrew,
who overcame Cornstalk at Point Pleasant, and who was thought of before Washington for command
of the Continental army, was nevertheless a remarkable man. He was of that Scotch-Irish
race which settled the western part of Pennsylvania and Virginia, and spread into North Carolina,
Kentucky, and Tennessee, making a people distinct in dialect and character, and preserving
a number of North of Ireland customs to this day. John was a famous Indian fighter in his
youth. At the time of the defence described in the ballad he had grown quite old. His wife,
who came of a fighting family, aided him to drive off the enemy, who would have endured almost
any loss to have secured him as a prisoner. They hated him intensely, and with just cause.
When red clover was introduced in that section, the savages believed that it was the white
clover, dyed in the blood of the Indians killed by the Lewises.</p>

<p class="no-indent">In the spring of 1775, General Gage, commanding the royal
troops in Boston, determined to seize the arms and stores
which the colonists had gathered at Concord. At midnight,
on the eighteenth of April, he sent eight
hundred men, grenadiers and light infantry,
under Lieutenant-colonel Smith
and Major Pitcairn, for that purpose.
They landed quietly at Phipps’s Farm,
and to insure secrecy arrested all they
met on the march. General Warren,
however, knew of it, and sent Paul
Revere with the news to John Hancock
and Samuel Adams, both of whom were
at Clark’s House, in Lexington. Revere
spread the alarm. By two o’clock in
the morning a company of minute-men
met on the green at Lexington, and after
forming were dismissed, with orders to
re-assemble on call. In the mean while the ringing of bells and firing of guns told the British
that their movements were known. Smith detached the greater part of his force, under Pitcairn,
with orders to push on to Concord. As
they approached Lexington they came upon
the minute-men, who had hastily turned out
again. A pause ensued, both parties hesitating.
Then Pitcairn called on them to disperse. Not
being obeyed, he moved his troops, and a few
random shots having been exchanged, gave
the order to fire. Four of the minute-men fell
at the volley, and the rest dispersed. As the
British fired again, while the Americans were
retreating, some shots were returned. Four
of the Americans were killed, and three of the
British were wounded. Joined by Smith and
his men, the British pushed on to Concord.</p>

<p>But the country was now thoroughly aroused.
A strong party of militia, though less in force
than the enemy, had been gathered under the
command of Colonel Barrett, an old soldier,
who had served with Amherst and Abercrombie.
Under his direction most of the stores
were removed to a place of safety. At seven
in the morning the British arrived at the
place, and found two companies of militia on
the Common. These retreated to some high<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
ground about a mile back. The enemy then occupied the town, secured the bridges, destroyed
what stores had been left, and broke off the trunnions of three 24-pound cannon.
They also fired the town. Meanwhile the forces of the Americans increased to four companies.
After consultation, Major Buttrick was sent with a detachment to attack the enemy at
the North Bridge. Here a fight ensued. Two Americans and three British were killed, and
several on both sides were wounded.
The British detachment retreated, and
the Americans took the bridge. The
enemy, seeing Americans continually
arriving, were alarmed, and Smith ordered
a speedy return to Boston, throwing
out flanking parties on the march.
But it seemed as though armed men
sprang from every house and barn, or
were lurking behind every rock and
tree. Shots came from every quarter,
and were mostly fatal. Charges had
no effect. Driven from one point,
fresh assailants came from another.
It seemed as though the entire detachment
would be slain or captured.</p>

<p>Gage received word of the swarming
of the minute-men and the peril of
his troops, and sent a brigade, with light
artillery, under Lord Percy, to reinforce
Smith. This reached within a half
mile of Lexington at three o’clock in
the afternoon, and forming a hollow
square around the wearied soldiers,
allowed them a short time for rest and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
refreshment. Then the whole body began its return march, destroying houses and doing other
mischief on the way. The country was now up, the provincial troops came from all quarters,
and it was a general running engagement. At Prospect Hill there was a sharp fight. Percy
seemed in danger of being cut off; but another and stronger reinforcement arriving, he was enabled
to reach Boston.</p>

ISLAND.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The Provincial Congress of South Carolina, in 1775, appointed a Committee of Safety to sit
during its own recess, and to this it delegated full power. The Committee fitted out a vessel,
which captured an English sloop, laden with powder,
lying at St. Augustine. The royal governor
of the State sent couriers to intercept the vessel,
but they failed. The powder was brought to
Charleston, and part of it was used by Arnold in
the siege of Quebec.
Later in the
year Colonel Moultrie
took possession
of a small fort
standing on Sullivan’s
Island, in
Charleston Harbor.
The governor fled
to the frigate <em>Tamar</em>,
and the Committee
of Safety
took charge of affairs.
Fort Johnson,
on James’s Island, was seized and armed.
Guns were mounted on Haddrell’s Point, and a
fascine battery made on Sullivan’s Island. Between
these two the <em>Tamar</em> and her consort were obliged to leave the harbor. Colonel Moultrie
was now ordered to build a strong fort on Sullivan’s Island, and over three hundred guns
were mounted on the various fortifications.
Colonel Gadsden was placed in command, and
every preparation made for a vigorous defence.</p>

<p>The Continental Congress
knew that a combined
naval and land
attack would be made
on Charleston; and in
April Brigadier-general
Armstrong was sent
there to take command,
but was superseded, on
the fourth of June, by
Major-general Charles
Lee, who had been sent
by Washington. He worked hard for the defence
of the city, and was supported with ardor
and enthusiasm by the people. Troops flocked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
in until there were between five and six thousand men in arms, including the Northern troops
that had come with Armstrong and Lee. They were disposed at Fort Johnson, on James’s
Island, under Gadsden; a battery on Sullivan’s Island, under Thomson; in the fort on the same
island, under Moultrie; and at Haddrell’s Point, under Lee.</p>

<p>The British arrived on the fourth of June, but it was not until the twenty-eighth that they
were ready to attack. During the interval they had constructed batteries on Long Island, to
silence that of Thomson on Sullivan’s Island and cover the landing of the storming-party of
Clinton’s troops.</p>

<p>On the morning of the twenty-eighth of June the attack began. The incidents are faithfully
given in the ballad, and to that the reader is referred.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>During the latter part of 1776, affairs looked gloomy for the new Confederacy of the States.
The affair at White Plains, the fall of Fort Washington, and the evacuation of Fort Lee, followed
by the retreat across New Jersey, had reduced the forces of Washington to less than
three thousand men. The enemy occupied Newark, New Brunswick, Princeton, Trenton, and
Bordentown. They were thus scattered in detachments on a long line. When Washington
crossed the river Delaware—which he did after securing every available boat on the shore—his
force had dwindled to twenty-two hundred men; and this number was still further reduced by
the expiration of the term of enlistment of a large portion. Congress had fled to Baltimore,
and Cornwallis was about to seize Philadelphia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span></p>

<p>Congress now ordered increased pay to the troops, with liberal bounties, and by indefatigable
exertions the ranks began to fill again. On the twenty-fourth of December, Washington’s
army amounted to over ten thousand men, of which about half were effective. With these
he determined to make a simultaneous attack upon the detached British posts on the New
Jersey side. The main force, led by Washington in person, was to cross at M’Conkey’s Ferry,
and fall upon the Hessians, under Rahl, at Trenton. Cadwallader was to cross near Bristol,
and Ewing below Trenton Falls, to attack Mount Holly, Black Horse, Bordentown, and Burlington.
He was aided unexpectedly by General Putnam, who commanded at Philadelphia. Learning
of the design to attack Trenton, Putnam sent a small body of militia, under Colonel Griffin,
to Mount Holly, where he was not to fight, but to retreat before the enemy. Count Donop,
at Bordentown, fell into the trap, followed
Griffin, and was not at hand to support
Rahl at the critical moment. Neither Ewing
nor Cadwallader could effect a crossing.
The latter got a battalion of foot over
the river, but not being able to cross the
artillery, these had to return.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent fs80">RAHL’S HEAD-QUARTERS.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The incidents of the surprise are correctly
given in the ballad. The loss of the
Americans was only four—two frozen to
death and two killed in battle. The loss
of the Hessians amounted to six officers
and over twenty men killed, and twenty-three
officers and eight hundred and eighty-six
privates made prisoners. Six brass
field-pieces, four colors, and a thousand stand of arms were also taken.</p>

<p>The effect of this movement was inspiriting, and gave great hope and encouragement to
the Americans. The English commander, who had thought the war was at an end, now
learned that his task had begun again. Numbers of Americans whose term of service had
expired re-enlisted, and the militia were eager to turn out whenever their services were
demanded.</p>

  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">We turned. A horseman was at hand, in gay apparel clad,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">A man of goodly presence. He gazed curiously at each,</div>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="FOLLOWING_THE_OPERATIONS_AT_TRENTON"><em>FOLLOWING THE OPERATIONS AT TRENTON.</em></h2>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>After the capture of the Hessians at Trenton, the American army, under the influence of
enthusiasm and a bounty of ten dollars, hard money, to each recruit, filled up rapidly. Washington
determined to re-occupy Trenton and make it the basis of offensive operations. He recrossed
the river on the 30th of December, and soon learned of the approach of Cornwallis
with a large force. The number of each army was the same; but the British were all well-trained
regulars, while the greater part of the Americans was made up of raw militia-men.
Washington moved to some high ground on the north side of the Assunpink, and guarded the
bridge spanning the stream. A strong party, under General Greene, had so harassed the enemy
that he did not reach Trenton until evening. He had driven Greene so close that he got over<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
the bridge with difficulty. There was a ford above, but this and the bridge were covered by
field-pieces. The British attempted to force the bridge, but were three times repulsed with
loss; and a similar attempt at the ford met with like
results. The action was kept up with cannon and musketry
until after dark, when it ceased, and both parties
lit their camp-fires, and prepared to renew hostilities in
the morning.</p>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Cornwallis, confident that Washington could not escape,
rested content. His antagonist knew the inferiority
of his troops and the probable disastrous consequences
of a general engagement. To avoid this, at
a council of war it was suggested to march off at night
down the river, and cross to Philadelphia. Washington
preferred to move upon Princeton, where a body
of British troops were stationed, and if possible reach
New Brunswick and destroy the enemy’s stores. There
was one difficulty in the way: it was impossible to
move forty pieces of artillery over the surrounding swamp. At that juncture it began to grow
intensely cold, and in two hours the marshy ground was frozen hard. The army moved in
silence, leaving camp-fires burning, and a small party to make a feint of intrenching. The
British were completely deceived. At morning the camp-fires were still blazing, but the Americans
had disappeared. While they were endeavoring
to find out what route Washington had taken, they
heard the booming of cannon at Princeton.</p>

<p>The Americans took what is known as the Quaker
road, which was new and full of stumps of trees. These
impeded their progress so much that it was about sunrise
before they reached the upper bridge over Stony
Brook, near Princeton, and formed in column near
Friends’ Meeting-house. Here they came on a brigade
of the enemy, under Mawhood, two regiments of which
were on their way to join Cornwallis. The latter discovered
the Americans, who now emerged from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
woods south of the meeting-house. Mawhood by a quick movement brought two of his regiments
to the bridge at Worth’s Mills, and crossed just as Mercer, who had been detached there
with a small party, reached it. Both parties tried to get possession of the high grounds. Mercer
reached Clark’s orchard, and finding the enemy approaching from the heights, sheltered his
riflemen behind a hedge, from which they poured a destructive fire. The enemy returned the
fire and charged, driving the Americans with the bayonet. They pursued, and when they came
to the brow of the heights, discovered the American force, under Washington, approaching. The
fugitives were re-formed, and a battery, under Moulder, began to play on Mawhood’s men. An
attempt to take this failed, and Mawhood, seeing a Connecticut regiment advancing, retreated,
leaving his artillery. It was during this affair that General Mercer received his death-wound.</p>

<p>The broken British managed to escape and joined Cornwallis, now on the advance. The
Americans, pushing on to Princeton, met the 55th regiment, which they routed, and that and
the 40th fled to New Brunswick. A few companies remained in the college, but these, under a
cannonade, surrendered. The bridge over Stony Brook was now destroyed, just as the van
of the British appeared. They forded the stream, but when at the town were brought up by
a single discharge from a 32-pounder which the British had before left on a temporary breastwork.
This gave them the idea that the Americans intended to make a stand, and they prepared
for battle. After some delay they threw out reconnoitring parties, and felt their way
cautiously, to discover that Washington was far away on the road to Millstone with his prisoners
and spoils. He destroyed the bridge at Kingston, and filed off to the left, arriving at Pluckemin
that night. Cornwallis, after repairing the bridge, supposed Washington had gone to New
Brunswick, and pushed on in that direction, to be disappointed.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The affair on which this lyric is founded is entirely different from the attack on the fort at
Schoharie by Johnson and Brant. It was a raid by a party of loyalists and Indians, led by a
Tory partisan, Donald M’Donald. He was an active and relentless leader; but not so bloody
as Walter Butler. He should not be confounded with the loyalist general of the same name in
North Carolina. He commanded part of the loyalists in the fight near Conewawah during Sullivan’s
expedition.</p>

<p>M’Donald died from wounds received in a very singular conflict. A German, named Schell—the
name usually spelled Shell—had founded a little settlement about five miles north of Herkimer,
which was known as Shell’s Bush. Here he built a block-house, the upper-story projecting
all around. One August afternoon, while the people were at work out-of-doors, M’Donald,
with sixty men, made a descent on the Bush. The inhabitants generally fled to Fort Dayton.
Schell saw the enemy almost too late, but managed to escape to the block-house, with two of his
sons—two others were taken. With the aid of Mrs. Schell, who loaded the guns, the little garrison
made a vigorous defence. M’Donald, failing in an attempt to burn the block-house, tried to
open the door with a crow-bar. A shot from Schell wounded him in the leg, and he was unable
to stand. Schell opened the door, dragged in M’Donald, and closed it. Then he stripped his
prisoner of all the cartridges he had. Schell felt he had an insurance against fire while his prisoner
was inside. But the enemy, enraged at the loss of some of their number, made a rush to
the house, and five of them put the ends of their pieces through the loop-holes. Mrs. Schell
bent the barrels with the blows of an axe, and Schell and his sons fired down on them. At dusk
Schell called to his wife from the second story, and told her that Captain Small was coming from
Fort Dayton. Presently he gave directions loudly to imaginary troops, and the enemy taking
fright ran away. M’Donald’s leg was taken off next day at Fort Dayton, but he died soon after
the operation.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The battle at Oriskany is one of the many instances during the Revolutionary contest
where disaster resulted through the rashness and insubordination of inferior officers. A
lack of discipline continually placed the cause in peril, and success was frequently won at a
cost which might have been avoided. The
enemy, under the command of Johnson and
Brant, were, fortunately for their antagonists,
troubled with the same fault. Had it been
otherwise, the Americans would have been exterminated.</p>

</figure>

<p>The enemy had laid siege to Fort Schuyler,
where Gansevoort lay with a small garrison.
General Herkimer, though without much pretensions
to military science, was a brave and
prudent officer, and perfectly fitted for the occasion.
He had called out the militia of Tryon
County to the number of eight hundred. His
plan was to make an attack upon the enemy
simultaneously with a sortie from the fort, and
he sent a messenger to effect that arrangement
with Gansevoort. The signal for Herkimer’s
advance was to be a single gun from Fort
Schuyler. It was some time before the scout
could make his way safely through the investing
force. In the mean while some of the men
grew impatient, and clamored for an immediate
advance. Colonels Cox and Paris headed this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
party, and when Herkimer refused they denounced
him as a coward. At length he submitted
to a precipitous movement, at the same
time saying that these very bold gentlemen
would be the first to run. And so it proved.</p>

</figure>

<p>The incidents of the fight are so minutely
given in the ballad that no further explanation
is needed. The Americans remained
masters of the field, but at a fearful loss, of
which that of Herkimer was not the least.
Had the original plan been followed, much
of the slaughter would have been spared.</p>

<p>There is no portrait of Herkimer in existence;
all that we learn of his appearance
was that he was short, stout, and full-faced.
He was a man of ability, and, had he survived,
from his character and courage he would
doubtless have figured creditably in the partisan
warfare waged in Eastern and Northern
New York, if not in a wider sphere of action.</p>

<p>When Burgoyne was making the descent from Canada which ended in his capture, he began
to fall short of provisions. Having learned that the colonists had a store of cattle, he despatched
Lieutenant-colonel Baum, with a force of Hessians, loyalists, and savages, to capture the stock
and drive it into camp. There were other ostensible objects, such as feeling the opinion of the
country and recruiting the corps of loyalists; but the main object was the capture of the cattle.
Baum received a sort of roving commission. He was ordered “to scour the country from Rockingham
to Otter Creek,” to go down the Connecticut to Brattleborough, return by the Albany
road, and rejoin Burgoyne, and to impress people with the belief that his force was the advance
guard of Burgoyne’s army on its way to Boston. He was to arrest all officers or men of the enemy
who were found to live off the country, and to impress all the horses in the way, “with as
many saddles and bridles as can be found.” There were to be thirteen hundred horses, at least,
taken, tied in tens for convenience. In short, Baum was to plunder.</p>

<p>The command marched, and on the next day, the 14th of August, 1777, they arrived at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
mill on Walloomscoick, after a little skirmish with some Americans who were guarding cattle at
Cambridge. Here Baum began to find that his march would not be a holiday parade.</p>

<p>People were uncertain as to the real destination of Burgoyne. He had partially succeeded
in convincing many that he meant to march on Boston. The Green Mountain men sent word to
Exeter imploring aid. The Provincial Assembly
of New Hampshire was called hastily together,
and its speaker, John Langdon, offered
a subsidy of several thousand dollars in hard
money to raise and equip troops, and suggested
that John Stark should take command.
Langdon’s words aroused his hearers. Two
brigades were raised, one under Whipple and
the other under Stark. The latter was then at
home. He had distinguished himself at Trenton
and Princeton, and had been sent home to
direct recruiting. While there, Congress promoted
several junior officers, and left his name
off. He resigned, but kept up active efforts
in behalf of the cause. He accepted the command
offered, with the stipulation that he
should act at his own discretion; and a part
of the brigade raised for him, and a part of
Whipple’s, was at once placed under his separate
command. Men flocked to his support,
and at Manchester, twenty miles north of Bennington,
he was joined by Colonel Warner, with
the remnant of the Vermont men from the disastrous
field of Hubbardton. At the same time
General Lincoln, who had been ordered to
conduct these new forces to the Hudson River, made his appearance. But Stark refused to yield
the command, notwithstanding Congress had passed a resolution that the agreement made between
him and New Hampshire was “highly prejudicial to the common cause.” He held his
position. Hearing of the skirmish at Cambridge, he sent a detachment to meet them. Learning
of Baum’s advance, he collected all the additional forces possible, and on the morning of the
14th he set forward to support the advance detachment. He
soon met the retreating advance under Gregg, and found the
enemy posted upon high ground near the Walloomscoick, where
they were throwing up hasty intrenchments. Stark fell back
to wait for support and plan his action; and Baum, alarmed
at the number of the Americans, sent an express to Burgoyne
asking for reinforcements. It resulted in Brayman being sent
with five hundred men; but they came too late to be of use.</p>

</figure>

<p>The next day there was a heavy rain, and both sides merely
made ready for the fight. The main part of Baum’s forces
were posted on the high ground, and intrenched as we have
stated; but a strong party, principally of Rangers, guarded the
ford where the Bennington road crossed. The loyalists, under
Peters, had a breastwork on the south side of the river, and
a few chasseurs at the mouth of a small water-course. Stark’s
main body was encamped on the Bennington road.</p>

<p>There had been skirmishing on the 15th, but the rain prevented
any active movement. The next morning was clear and
bright, and Stark at once proceeded with his plan. It involved a simultaneous attack of various
parties on the intrenchments of the enemy, while the main body under Stark drove the Tories
upon the fortified Hessians, and the latter out of their fortified hold. The battle lasted two
hours, and in spite of the obstinate bravery of Reidesel’s dragoons, led by Baum in person, was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
won by the Americans. But as soon as this was done, the undisciplined troops began to disperse
in search of plunder. Brayman came up with his fresh men, rallied Baum’s flying troops, and
renewed battle, with every prospect of retrieving the fortunes of the day; but Colonel Warner’s
small force coming up and meeting the enemy, with the assistance of the scattered forces Stark
was enabled to bring into action, the tide changed again. At sunset the victory was complete.
The loss of the Americans was less than two hundred killed and wounded; of the British, in
killed, wounded, and prisoners, nine hundred and thirty-five. Among the spoils were four brass
cannon, several hundred stands of arms, two hundred and fifty dragoon swords, and four ammunition

<h3><em>THE BATTLE OF BENNINGTON.</em></h3>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">I see that August morning now before me as I tell</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The story of the stirring scenes which I remember well—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The battle-day of Bennington, and what thereon befell.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Yes! we were in the stubble where the hands had gone at dawn,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When, riding swiftly down the road, his dappled gray upon,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Whose flanks were marked with blood and foam, I saw my brother John.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His face was bright, his eyes alight, his bearing proud and high—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">“Ho! whither do you speed so fast? Why do you hurry by,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">While friends are eager for the news, John Manchester?” said I.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“To fight!” he cried; “who stays at home upon this August day,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Now Stark has come to Bennington, to lead us in the fray,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Where we may smite these Hessian wolves who babes and women slay?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Let baser men remain at toil, as such have done before,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Let women spin and children play before the farm-house door;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But till these knaves are driven hence I till the ground no more.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Come you and join me in the strife that Lexington began;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And as the foe comes down on us, and dares us man to man,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Let you and I acquit ourselves as stout Vermonters can.”</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">The words he uttered on our hearts fell fast in fiery rain;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The blood in wilder current coursed through artery and vein;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">An impulse there to do and dare went swiftly through each brain.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Our sight and hearing keener grew before his voice’s tone—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">We saw the cottage roof aflame, the corn-crib overthrown;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">We heard the widow’s woful wail, the famished orphan’s moan.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">We thrilled from heart to finger-tip; the very air grew red;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And casting by the tools of toil, off to the house we sped,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To wipe the chambers of our guns and mould the deadly lead.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">My mother met me at the door—“James, stay at home!” said she;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">“If you, my youngest born, should fall, what would become of me?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And then, a boy in such a fight of little use can be—”</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">With that she raised her hand to brush away an oozing tear,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And added—“It was but in June you reached your sixteenth year;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">So, while your brother is away, remain to guard us here.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">These Hessians whom the king has sent, a hireling war to wage</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">On children as on bearded men, are ruthless in their rage;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Then go not hence to fall in fight, child of your mother’s age.”</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Fear not for me,” I answered her; “the Hessians I defy;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In years a boy, I know, but then a man in heart am I;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">My country needs me in the fight—I cannot more than die.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I come of Abner Manchester, who never knew a fear;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And though as much as any one I hold my mother dear,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I may not on this day of days remain a laggard here.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To herd with women while the fight for freedom is unwon,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">While he has sight to mark a foe and strength to bear a gun,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Suits not a stout Green Mountain Boy, nor yet my father’s son.”</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“If you will leave me here alone, so be it!” she replied;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">“But take yon firelock from the hooks—it was your father’s pride—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He bore it well against the French, nine years before he died—”</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As thus she spoke my mother’s voice grew tremulous in tone—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">“And when you use it, lest your foe in lingering anguish moan,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Sight at a point two fingers’ length beneath the collar-bone.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Now, go! my heart, as thus we part, thrills with a mother’s pain;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To save you from a single pang, its latest drop I’d drain;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But—show the courage of your sire, or come not here again!”</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">We started, six of us in all; we made to camp our way,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And found the forces drawn in line, at two o’clock that day,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In front of where, on Walloomscoick, intrenched the foemen lay.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Bold Stark rode slowly down the ranks, with proud, uncovered head—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">So quiet we that on the turf we heard his horse’s tread—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And at the centre drew his rein, and these the words he said—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">“Boys! yonder are the red-coat troops, and, mark me every one,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">We win this fight for truth and right, before the day be done,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Or Molly Stark’s a widow at the setting of the sun!”</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Loud rang the cheering in reply, but through the ranks there ran</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A murmur, for they felt it long until the fight began,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Although they knew the tardiness was from a well-formed plan.</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">For in their hurried council there our leaders planned the fight,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That Herrick with three hundred men should march upon their right,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And Nichols on the left with more spared from our scanty might,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To join their forces in the rear, and there assault begin,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">While we upon their front advanced at signal of the din;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And then let those who dealt their blows with fiercest vigor win.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Our forces stood without a stir, in silence grim and dark,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">While like a statue on his steed so motionless sat Stark,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When suddenly, with finger raised, the general whispered—“Hark!”</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">We stood as silent as the grave, and as we bent to hear,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Above the silence far away there came a lusty cheer;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Some shots were fired—we knew our friends had joined upon their rear—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">“Now, hearts so warm, move like the storm!” said Stark, and led the way;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">“Green Mountain Boys, acquit yourselves like mettled men to-day!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Take careful aim and waste no lead! the wolves are brought to bay!”</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Then came the crash of musketry loud pealing on my ear;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I heard a whizzing sound go past—down fell a comrade near—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">There was a throbbing in my breast that seemed almost like fear—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A shock, to see a stout young man, in all his youth and pride,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">One who had left the day before a fond and blooming bride,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thus done to death, the scarlet blood slow trickling from his side;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And doubly strange that fearful sight to one who ne’er before,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Amid the shouting of the hosts, and the cannon’s deadly roar,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Had seen a fellow-mortal lie thus lifeless in his gore.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">But rage supplanted this at once—my heart grew strong again;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Uprose grim wrath and bitter hate, and bitterer disdain.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I longed to add a leaden drop unto that whizzing rain—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The tenderness of youth I found forevermore had gone.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">My cheek was leaned upon my gun, the sight was finely drawn</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Upon a gold-laced officer who cheered the Hessians on;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And, trembling in my eagerness to strike for home a blow,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I sent the lead, as mother said, two fingers’ length below</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The ridge that marked the collar-bone, and laughed when fell the foe.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">There comes a pause within the fight—we see some horsemen group,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And on the breastwork ridge take line, a dark and threatening troop—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Compact they form, with sabres drawn, upon our force to swoop.</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Oh, now we smile a grimly smile, and wrath our bosom stirs;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">We newly load and careful prime our firelocks for the curs—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For well we know their uniform, those Brunswicker chasseurs!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">They come at last whose doom was past long, weary months before—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">They come to meet the death that we to deal upon them swore</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When first the bearded robbers came for plunder to our shore.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">They come, the mercenary dogs, assassins of the crown;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Right gracefully and gallantly they sit their horses brown,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Then rowel-deep they drive their spurs, and thunder madly down.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But as the ground is shaking round before their horses’ tread,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A sheet of fire their sabres lights, high waving overhead,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And of the hundred men who charge full forty-eight lie dead.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Those who survive in vain they strive; they may not fight nor run—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">We pass them quickly to the rear, our captives every one.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And so we serve the Brunswicker that day at Bennington.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Then where their remnant lay at bay our angry torrent rolled—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As when a dam gives way, and leaves the waters uncontrolled—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Sweeping to break the square of steel in centre of their hold.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">No peal of trump nor tap of drum our eager footsteps timed;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With firelocks clubbed or knife in hand, our faces powder-grimed,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Fatigue unfelt and fear unknown, the ridge of earth we climbed;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Down from its crest we fearless plunged amid the smoke clouds dun,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But struck no blow upon the foe—resistance there was none—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Down fell their arms, uprose the white, and Bennington was won.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Then greeted we surviving friends, and mourned for those who fell,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And, leaning on our firelocks, heard the tales that soldiers tell</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">How comrades whom they little knew had done their duty well,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And how amid the hosts in fight no coward had been found;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Then gazed upon the foemen slain that lay in heaps around,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And said, in bitter hate and scorn, they well became the ground—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">So evermore by sea and shore might those invaders be,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Who came with chains for limbs of men who by their birth were free—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A pang shot sharply through my brain—my brother! where was he?</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">I sought and found him with the blood slow oozing from his brain;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His feet were pointed to the ridge, his back was to the plain,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And round him in a curving row a dozen Hessians slain.</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">How well his sword had mown was shown in gazing at the heap—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Strown like a swathe of grass before some lusty mower’s sweep—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of those whose souls had fled their forms through bloody wounds and deep.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I placed his corse upon his horse, and gently homeward led</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The wearied steed that ne’er before was ridden by the dead;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And we buried the corse in the meadow with a white stone at its head.</div>

<p class="center no-indent fs80">[From an English Print, 1783.]</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The way for the operations which resulted in the capture
of Burgoyne and his forces was mainly prepared by
General Schuyler, who was unjustly replaced by Gates.
The battles at Stillwater rendered the result a certainty.
The surrender of Burgoyne and his forces, by showing the
probability of success, secured the French alliance. The
value of that consisted in the fact that it gave Great Britain
more to do, and prevented her from crushing the new
States, which had declared their independence from “the
State of Great Britain.” Up to that time Louis the Sixteenth
had only given us covert assistance. Then he, unwisely
for himself, declared war against England, leading
to a train of events which crystallized the memory of long
years of oppression of the French people into revolution.
The king did not foresee the consequences. Joseph the
Second of Austria was more shrewd. When urged to join
the alliance against Great Britain he said—“I am a sovereign,
and will not aid to injure my own trade.” The
material assistance afforded by France was slight, and at
Savannah injurious. The French were at Yorktown, but
Cornwallis would have fallen without their aid. Afterwards
they not only claimed the laurels, but affected to consider us as a French dependency, and
carried it so far as to provoke us to war.
We owe France nothing; but we owe much
to the memory of the Marquis de la Fayette,
who generously placed at our disposal his
life and fortune; who was our disinterested
friend at a critical period and throughout;
and who will be remembered with gratitude
so long as the Union remains.</p>

<p>Whether Arnold distinguished himself at
the first battle of Stillwater may be a moot
question. That he was a moving spirit in
the second battle is undoubted. The victory
was very much due to his exertions. Up to
the time of his treason, despite his rapacity
and extravagance at Philadelphia, he merited
praise for his dash, bravery, and unflinching
devotion to the cause of Independence. That
he was treated badly by the Congress is true;
but that is scarcely a palliation of his infamous
conduct in revenge. The Congress
seems to have had a faculty for injustice. As
it acted towards Arnold, so it did to Paul
Jones, John Stark, and Philip Schuyler. But
none of the last named revenged themselves
by treason. The contrast between the conduct
of Arnold and Schuyler is particularly notable. The latter had managed affairs with dexterity,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
and it was to his prudence, decision, and skill
that the surrender of Burgoyne was mainly due. At
the last moment he was superseded by Gates, under
circumstances calculated to arouse his resentment.
Schuyler, unlike Arnold, was not merely a patriot, but
a man of honor. He was ready to submit to wrong
rather than betray the cause. The conduct of Arnold
was the baser from the fact that Washington, who felt
that the man had been wronged, labored to do him
right, and had placed him in the responsible command
of West Point, to pave the way to that distinction his
services on the battle-field deserved. Arnold, therefore,
added ingratitude and breach of confidence to
treason. He seems to have had the courage of a
bull-dog, but to have been totally lacking in moral
principle.</p>

<p>When I was a boy I met an old Revolutionary
soldier who had served under Arnold. He would
praise him for his bravery in one minute, and denounce
his treachery the next, rarely speaking of
him without tears. Hence the idea of the ballad.</p>

<p>In 1771, a stockade fort was erected at the mouth of Wheeling Creek, in what was then the
district of West Augusta, in Virginia, to protect the settlers against a threatened invasion of
the savages. It was called Fort Fincastle, and is said to have been planned by George Rogers
Clarke. The original garrison was twenty-five men; but though this was afterwards ordered to
be doubled, it is doubtful if the command
were ever obeyed. In 1776, when the colonists
rebelled against the crown, and West
Augusta was divided into the counties of
Ohio, Youghiogheny, and Monongahela, the
name was changed to Fort Henry, in honor
of Patrick Henry, then governor of Virginia.</p>

<p>The organization of Ohio County at this
time was essentially military, every able-bodied
man being enrolled; and this enrollment
was a list of taxables, and formed the
basis of the county revenue. David Shepherd,
the colonel commanding the county
militia, was also the presiding justice of the
county court. Besides this the county had to
raise two companies as a part of the Continental
Army. These were commanded respectively
by Captains John Lemmon and
Silas Zane; but as they appear never to have
enlisted more than twenty men, the project
was probably abandoned.</p>

<p>Fort Henry was the only fortified place
capable of a protracted defence, though there
were block-houses in the settlements at Peach
Bottom, Grave Creek, Short Creek, and Cross Creek. It stood on high ground a short distance
above the mouth of Wheeling Creek, and near it were twenty or thirty log-houses, the beginning
of what is now the flourishing city of Wheeling. The famous attack upon it was made in September,
1777. During the spring of that year frequent aggressions had been made upon the
white settlements by thieving bands of Indians, and these attacks had been either repulsed or
the marauders followed up and chastised. During the summer these increased, and the result
was a cessation of ordinary occupations, and an understood placing of the country under martial
law. At the beginning of September it was learned that Simon Girty, a notorious white renegade,
was raising a strong band of Wyandots, Mingoes, and Shawanock—mainly of the former. So
well did their leader manage, however, that he brought his band, from four to five hundred in
number, to the walls of Fort Henry before his real points of attack were known.</p>

<p>On the night of the 26th of September, a small scouting party discovered smoke arising at the
south of Wheeling Creek. Captain Ogle, one of these, thought it came from the burning of the
block-house at Grave Creek; and Colonel Shepherd sent out to ascertain the truth, and caused
the families living around to take refuge in the fort. The next morning his scouts sent to warn
neighboring settlements were fired on, and one of them killed, by six lurking Indians. A party
of fifteen, sent to dislodge these, encountered the main force, and all but three were killed. A<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
party sent to their aid, lost two-thirds of their number. These losses cut down the garrison to
twelve men and boys. The assailing force, which now closely invested the garrison, was never
estimated at less than three hundred and eighty, but was probably much more.</p>

<p>During the whole of the day the fight was maintained with great vigor. The Indians at one
time made an impromptu cannon of a huge log, winding it around with chains from the blacksmith’s
shop in the village, loading it with round stones, and directing it against the gate of the
fort. It exploded, and killed and wounded several of the besiegers. The next morning, relief
came in the shape of forty men, under M’Culloch, from Short Creek, and fourteen more from
Cross Creek. The enemy burned the houses around, carried off the cattle, and, bearing their
dead, moved away.</p>

<p>During the fight, the defenders grew short of powder. There was a keg in Ebenezer Zane’s
house about sixty yards away, and this was obtained by the sister of Ebenezer, a young woman,
in the way described in the ballad.</p>

</div>

<p>In June, 1777, the American army was still encamped at Valley Forge. Instructions had
been sent from England to Sir Henry Clinton, who replaced Howe as commander-in-chief, to
evacuate Philadelphia, and make New York the centre of his operations. So prudently did he
prepare for this step that Washington knew nothing of his intention until the British army was
actually over the Delaware. A council of war held at Valley Forge decided adversely to an attack
upon the enemy, but Washington took up the pursuit, determined to act according to circumstances.
He sent Arnold, who was incapacitated for action in the field, with a small detachment
to take possession of Philadelphia, while he crossed the river at Coryell’s Ferry, above Trenton.
Clinton, who had to build bridges all along his route, and who was encumbered with baggage and
stores, so that on the single effective road he found his train was twelve miles long, was slow in
his movements. This, somehow, produced an impression that he meant to draw on a general
engagement. An American council of war was called at Hopewell, which still opposed a battle,
but recommended harassing the enemy by detachments. Washington ordered Morgan’s corps
to the British right flank, Maxwell’s brigade to the left, and Scott’s picked corps, with some
forces under Dickinson and Cadwallader, to annoy them on flanks and rear.</p>

<p>Clinton’s first plan was to strike New Brunswick and embark at the Raritan; but at Allentown,
finding Washington in his way, and disinclined to a general engagement under the circumstances,
he moved to the right, intending to pass Monmouth Court-house and embark at Sandy
Hook. The Americans were now at Kingston. Lee and all the general officers, except La Fayette,
Greene, and Wayne, were in favor of continuing the system of annoyance; but Washington
at last made ready for a battle. He ordered forward Wayne with a thousand men to support
the troops most in advance, giving La Fayette the command of the advanced force—about four
thousand in all—while he moved the main body towards Cranberry. On the morning of the 27th,
La Fayette arrived at Englishtown. By this time Clinton had made a different disposition of
his forces, throwing his grenadiers to his rear, and placing the encumbrances in front under charge
of Knyphausen. He made his camp in a strong position near the court-house, in a line three
miles in length, protected by woods and marshes. This forced Washington to support his advance
strongly, and he sent Lee forward to join La Fayette with two brigades at Englishtown,
which placed Lee in command then as senior officer. The corps of Morgan still threatened the
enemy’s right, and Dickinson’s force his left. Washington, fearing the enemy would take post
on Middletown Heights, determined to attack the rear on a movement in that direction, and sent
orders to Lee to prepare for an assault.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span></p>

</figure>

<p>The next day, the 28th, was Sunday, and bade fair to be, as it became, one of the hottest days
of the season. An hour after midnight, Lee ordered Dickinson forward with a strong party of observation,
and directed Morgan to attack the British
as soon as they moved. The rest of the
troops were ordered to prepare to march, and
before dawn, Scott and Varnum’s brigades were
moving slowly towards the court-house; at daybreak,
Knyphausen, with his Hessians and loyalists;
and at eight o’clock Clinton followed with
the main body. The whole American army was
put in motion, and Lee received orders to attack,
unless he saw very powerful reasons otherwise.
This discretionary clause had like to
have resulted in defeat. Dickinson having received
word that the British were about to attack
with the main force, which was incorrect, sent
the news to Lee, who believed it. He pushed
forward across the morass to a narrow road
near the parsonage, and joined Dickinson on
the heights. Here the news brought was conflicting,
and while Lee was trying to get it correctly,
Lafayette came up with the rest of the
advanced corps. Learning that the enemy was
not in force on either flank, he marched on.
He had between five and six thousand men, including
those under Morgan and Dickinson.
He pressed forward, under cover of the woods,
formed a part of his line for action, and rode
forward with Wayne far enough to see that the British deploying on the left were merely a
heavy covering party. Hoping to cut them off from the main army, he detached Wayne with
seven hundred men and two field-pieces to
make a feint in the rear.</p>

<figure class="figright illowp45" id="101-2" style="max-width: 54.625em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/101-2.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent fs80">GENERAL WAYNE.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>About nine o’clock, the Queen’s Dragoons
being observed on a height, apparently preparing
to attack, Lee ordered the light-horse
to let them nearly approach, and then to fall
back on Wayne. This manœuvre would
have succeeded, had not a small party under
Butler fired at them from ambush, which
caused them to fall back. Wayne ordered the
artillery to open on them, and then charged,
Oswald opening fire from an eminence in
the morass. Wayne was attacking with vigor,
when to his chagrin he received an order
from Lee to move less vigorously, lest he
might prevent the latter from cutting off the
covering party. Wayne obeyed, but Lee
brought his forces from under cover in detachments
only. Sir Henry Clinton, fearing
that the Americans were massing on both
flanks for the purpose of capturing his baggage,
faced about to attack Lee, and force
those threatening his flanks to come to the
latter’s aid. Lafayette seeing this, asked
permission of Lee to attempt gaining the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
rear of the enemy. Lee refused at first, but finally agreed to let him attack the enemy’s left;
but weakened Lafayette by withdrawing three regiments to the support of the right. Riding
forward to reconnoitre, Lee saw, or thought he saw, a
heavy force marching on the Middletown road towards
the court-house. He ordered the right to fall back.
The British were advancing with the apparent design
of gaining the American rear, just as Scott and Maxwell’s
brigades were approaching the enemy’s right, the
former forming for action. Lee ordered both to fall back,
arrange their line in the woods, and await orders. Mistaking
the nature of the order, they retreated through
the woods towards Freehold meeting-house. As soon
as Lee learned this, instead of recalling them, he sent
word to Lafayette to fall back on the court-house,
which he obeyed, the enemy pursuing him as far as
the latter place, where they halted. Both parties suffered
from the extreme heat, their men in some instances
dropping exhausted. Lee made one stand, and then resumed
his retreat. It degenerated into a panic. Numbers
were lost in the morass—few perished by ball. There was little firing on either side.</p>

<p>During this time Washington was moving to Lee’s support. For Lee, when he discovered
the large covering party in the enemy’s rear, and had planned to cut them off, sent word to the
commander-in-chief of his purpose. On the receipt of this message, Washington had despatched
Greene with the right wing by Freehold Meeting-house, to prevent the enemy turning that flank,
while he prepared to move the left in the rear of Lee, in support. Suddenly came the news that
Lee was retreating, with Clinton in pursuit. Washington was astounded. There had been little
firing to indicate battle, and, riding forward, he met the head of the retreating force. Halting
it, he pushed on and found Lee at the head of the second column. He demanded in an angry
way the meaning of the confusion, and Lee, who also lost his temper, replied harshly. A few
hasty and bitter words passed, when Washington rode on, stayed the troops, and ordered Oswald
to check the progress of the enemy with his cannon. The men under Stewart and Ramsay
were formed in battle order. Then
Washington turned to the chafed Lee,
and said, “Will you command in that
place, sir?” Lee replied in the affirmative.
“Then,” said Washington, “I expect
you to attack the enemy immediately.”
“Your command shall be obeyed,
sir,” replied Lee, “and I will not be the
first to leave the field.”</p>

<p>While Washington was bringing order
out of the confusion elsewhere, and
disposing properly of Greene’s forces,
and the left wing under Stirling, Lee vigorously
carried out his orders; but the
force of the enemy was too overwhelming.
After a vigorous fight, he brought
them under cover of a fire by Ogden,
detailed for that purpose, he being “the
last to leave the field,” and forming
them in line on the slope, reported to Washington for further orders. Washington seeing the
men were worn out, ordered him to arrange them at Englishtown, while he attacked with the
main body. The action now became hot all along the line, and was pursued with varying success,
until at length, towards sunset, the British army, badly worsted, fell back upon the heights
held by Lee in the morning. It was a strong position, flanked by forest and morass, but Washington<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
prepared to attack it. The darkness coming on, the men
were ordered to sleep on their arms, and to move at daylight.</p>

<p>But this was unneeded. At midnight, Clinton silently stole off;
and when dawn came he was so far away towards New Brunswick,
that pursuit was useless. The Americans lost in the battle sixty-seven
killed, one hundred and sixty wounded, and one hundred
and thirty missing; but a number of the last had been merely prostrated by the extreme heat,
and afterward rejoined their commands. There were two hundred and forty-nine of the British
left dead on the field, of whom fifty-nine died of sunstroke. The number of their wounded is
unknown.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="JOHN_BERRY_THE_LOYALIST"><em>JOHN BERRY, THE LOYALIST.</em></h2>
</div>


<div class="blockquot">

<p>There is scarcely a native of Bergen County, in New Jersey, who has not heard of Jack, the
Regular, and by the older residents there are still told a number of stories of his cruelty and
rapacity. That there was such a person, that he was an active loyalist during the Revolutionary
war, and that he was finally killed by the Van Valens, and his lifeless body brought into Hackensack
in a wagon, there seems to be no doubt. But with all my industrious endeavor I have
never been able to get particulars as to his family, the date of his birth, or when he was killed.
I find that his real name was John Berry, and that he managed to gain rank as a captain—probably
of loyalists. His nickname arose from a boast he made that he was no marauder, but held
a regular commission from his Gracious Majesty. Hence those who sided with the Americans
called him Jack, the Regular, and he was scarcely ever known by another name.</p>

<p>So far as I can learn he was killed on the slope of the Palisade ridge, not far from what is
known as the Ridgefield station, on the Northern Railroad, and by a long shot. It was merely
fired in vexation by Van Valen, who was astonished when the partisan fell, and hesitated for
some time to verify the fact of his death. Jack’s band at that time had been broken up, or he
was in some disgrace; for he had had apparently no command for some time before he was
killed, and was with but one companion at the time.</p>

<p>After his disaster at Camden, Gates was superseded in the command of the Southern Departments
by Greene, to whom he turned over the remnant of his army, about two thousand men
in all. Of these a force of a thousand, or less, were placed
in Union District, near the junction of the Broad and Pacolet
rivers, nearly fifty miles to the left of Greene’s position.
Lord Cornwallis at once determined to attack and
destroy this detachment, and sent. Tarleton, with eleven
hundred men, including his own cavalry and two field-pieces,
for that purpose. Morgan’s forces, outside of
Howard’s Continentals and Washington’s dragoons, were
raw militia, some of whom had never seen battle, had had
little drill, and were devoid of discipline. The task was
supposed to be easy, and Tarleton began his march in
high spirits. In consequence of bad roads he was much
delayed on the march, and it was not until the 15th of January,
1781, four days after starting, that he drew near the
Pacolet. Morgan, finding his forces not sufficient to stop
the enemy at the river, retreated and took post on the
north side of Thickety Mountain, near the Cowpens.
Tarleton at once pushed on in pursuit, leaving his baggage behind, riding all night, and at eight
o’clock of the morning of the 17th came in sight of the American patrol. Fearing they might
escape he ordered an immediate attack. To
his surprise he found Morgan prepared to
give battle.</p>

<p>It is unnecessary to expand this note further,
since the movements in the battle are
given with accuracy in the ballad. The pursuit
of the British was not relinquished until
they reached the open wood near or about the
point where the fight first began. The remnant
of Tarleton’s force, by the next morning,
reached Cornwallis’s camp. The American
loss was twelve killed and about forty-eight
wounded. Cornwallis’s report to Sir Henry
Clinton gives the British loss at one hundred
killed and five hundred and twenty-three
prisoners. The Americans captured the two
field-pieces, two standards, eight hundred
muskets, thirty-five baggage-wagons, and one
hundred dragoon horses. The battle was not
so important itself but in its consequences.
It contributed very much towards the capture
of Cornwallis.</p>

  </div>
  <div class="stanza">

    <div class="verse indent0">Until some one near me spoke, in voice than falling water clearer,</div>

  </div>
  <div class="stanza">

<p>The massacre at Cherry Valley, New York, was notably cruel and bloody. In November,
1778, Walter Butler, with two hundred loyalists, and Joseph Brant, with five hundred Indians,
swept down on the place, and commenced an indiscriminate slaughter. The very loyalists
among the inhabitants were not spared. John Wells was well affected to the crown, yet he and
his family, with the exception of
his son John, who happened to
be in Schenectady, were killed.
Jane Wells was very much esteemed
for her kindness and
other good qualities. The elder
Wells was a particular friend
of Colonel John Butler, Walter’s
father, who said, when he heard
of his death, “I would have
gone miles on my hands and
knees to have saved that family,
and why my son did not do it
God only knows.” One loyalist,
Peter Smith, who had formerly
been a servant in the family,
tried to save Miss Jenny, but
the Indian who had seized her
struck her on the head with his
tomahawk and killed her. One
man by the name of Mitchell
was at a distance, saw the savages
approaching, and finding
that he could not rejoin his
family, escaped into the woods.
On his return he found his
house burning, and near it lay
the bodies of his wife and four
children. One of these, a little
girl, was still living, when he
saw a party approach. He
dropped the child, and secreted
himself behind a tree. One of
the new-comers saw the child
to be alive yet, and stooping,
brained her with a hatchet.
The wretch was not an Indian,
but a white loyalist savage
named Newbery, who was afterwards
hanged as a spy by General James Clinton. Brant saved a number of prisoners, and
would have spared the women and children, but Walter Butler denied all appeals for mercy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span></p>

<p>Butler’s time was to come. On the 22d of August, 1781, Colonel Willet attacked a force of
five hundred loyalists and Indians at Johnstown, and defeated them. They were commanded
by Major Ross and Walter Butler. The remnant of the enemy retreated all that night, and could
not be overtaken. It was during that retreat that Butler was killed in the manner related in
the ballad. Skenando, the Oneida chief, who is supposed to have been his slayer, was about
seventy-four years old at the time. He lived many years after, dying at the age of one hundred
and ten, on March 19, 1816. His burial was attended by a large number of citizens. A short
time before his death he said to a visitor, who made some inquiries about his age, “I am an
old hemlock. The winds of a hundred winters have whistled through my top. The generation
to which I belonged has gone and left me. Pray to my Jesus that I may have patience to wait
for my appointed time to die.”</p>

<p>From the narrative of a survivor of the gallant men who participated in the fight at King’s
Mountain I wrote the ballad, and aimed to give it the simple style of the narrator. But the
old man, perfectly truthful in intent, fell into some errors. He omits all mention of the
M’Dowells. Colonel M’Dowell was not in the battle. He objected to fighting a battle without
a general officer, and he was despatched in search of one. While gone, the rest elected Colonel
Campbell to command, and got to work. Major M’Dowell however remained, and commanded
the regiments. He calls Shelby, Evan Shelby. But Evan Shelby, who was Isaac’s father, and
who distinguished himself at Point Pleasant, was not at King’s Mountain.</p>

<p>The official account of the battle transmitted to Gates, and probably the correct one, is as
follows:</p>

<p>“On receiving intelligence that Major Ferguson had advanced up as high as Gilbert Town,
in Rutherford County, and threatened to cross the mountains to the Western waters, Colonel
William Campbell, with four hundred men, of Washington County, of Virginia, Colonel Isaac
Shelby, with two hundred and forty men from Sullivan County, of North Carolina, and Lieutenant-colonel
Sevier, with two hundred and forty men, of
Washington County, of North Carolina, assembled at
Watauga, on the twenty-fifth day of September, where
they were joined by Colonel Charles M’Dowell, with one
hundred and sixty men, from the counties of Burke and
Rutherford, who had fled before the enemy to the Western
waters. We began our march on the twenty-sixth,
and on the thirtieth we were joined by Colonel Cleaveland,
on the Catawba River, with three hundred men,
from the counties of Wilkes and Surrey. No one officer
having properly the right to the command-in-chief, on
the first of October we despatched an express to Major-general
Gates, informing him of our situation, and requested
him to send a general officer to take command
of the whole. In the mean time, Colonel Campbell was
chosen to act as commandant, till such general officer
should arrive. We marched to the <em>Cowpens</em>, on Broad
River, in South Carolina, where we were joined by
Colonel James Williams, with four hundred men, on the
evening of the sixth of October, who informed us that
the enemy lay encamped somewhere near the Cherokee Ford, off Broad River, about thirty miles
distant from us. By a council of principal officers, it was then thought advisable to pursue the
enemy that night with nine hundred of the best horsemen, and have the weak horse and foot
men to follow us as fast as possible. We began our march with nine hundred of the best men
about eight o’clock the same evening, and, marching all night, came up with the enemy about
three o’clock P.M. of the seventh, who lay encamped on the top of King’s Mountain, twelve
miles north of the Cherokee Ford, in the confidence that they could not be forced from so advantageous
a post. Previous to the attack on our march, the following disposition was made:
Colonel Shelby’s regiment formed a column in the centre on the left; Colonel Campbell’s regiment
another on the right, with part of Colonel Cleaveland’s regiment, headed in front by Major<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
Joseph Winston; and Colonel Sevier’s formed a large column on the right wing. The other
part of Cleaveland’s regiment, headed by Colonel Cleaveland himself, and Colonel Williams’s
regiment, composed the left wing. In this order we advanced, and got within a quarter of a
mile of the enemy before we were discovered. Colonel Shelby’s and Colonel Campbell’s regiments
began the attack, and kept up a fire on the enemy, while the right and left wings were
advancing to surround them, which was done in about five minutes, when the fire became general
all around. The engagement lasted an hour and five minutes, the greater part of which a
heavy and incessant fire was kept up on both sides. Our men, in some parts where the regulars
fought, were obliged to give way a distance, two or three times, but rallied and returned with
additional ardor to the attack. The troops upon the right having gained the summit of the
eminence, obliged the enemy to retreat along the summit of the ridge to where Colonel Cleaveland
commanded, and were there stopped by his brave men. A flag was immediately hoisted
by Captain Depeyster, the commanding officer (Major Ferguson having been killed a little before),
for a surrender. Our fire immediately ceased, and the enemy laid down their arms (the
greater part of them charged) and surrendered themselves prisoners at discretion. It appears
from their own provision returns for that day, found in their camp, that their whole force consisted
of eleven hundred and twenty-five men, out of which they sustained the following loss:</p>

<p>“Of the regulars, one major, one captain, two sergeants, and fifteen privates killed; thirty-five
privates wounded, left on the ground not able to march; two captains, four lieutenants, three
ensigns, one surgeon, five sergeants, three corporals, one drummer, and forty-nine privates taken
prisoners.</p>

<p>“Loss of the Tories: two colonels, three captains, and two hundred and one killed; one major
and one hundred and twenty-seven privates wounded, and left on the ground not able to march.
One colonel, twelve captains, eleven lieutenants, two ensigns, one quartermaster, one adjutant,
two commissaries, eighteen sergeants, and six hundred privates taken prisoners.</p>

<p>“Total loss of the enemy, eleven hundred and five men at King’s Mountain.</p>

<p>“Given under our hands at camp.</p>

</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The event which forms the subject of the ballad occurred in Nelson County, Kentucky, during
the summer of 1787. About midnight, the approach of a hostile party was made known to
John Merrill and his wife, by the barking of their house-dog. At first, Merrill supposed it to be
some travellers seeking shelter, and opened the door. He received the fire of a half-dozen rifles,
which broke an arm and a thigh. He fell, and his wife, at his call, closed the door. The Indians
broke open the door, but Mrs. Merrill, who was a very large and powerful woman, killed
four of them with an axe, and they gave that up. They next climbed the roof to effect an entrance
by the broad chimney. There was a fire smouldering on the hearth, and on this Mrs.
Merrill threw the feathers of the bed, which she had ripped open. The smoke caused two of the
remaining three Indians to fall insensible. Braining these, she ran to the open door where the
last surviving savage was entering. He was too close for her to strike, but she cut his cheek
with the keen blade of the axe. He gave a yell of affright and despair, and fled, spreading a
terrible story of the strength and courage of his female antagonist. A similar instance of female
courage is that of Mrs. Dustan, in New England; but in the latter case the victims were asleep.</p>

</figure>

<p>There is no event in American history which seems to be so misunderstood, especially in
details, as the battle fought in New Orleans after the close of the war of 1812. The commander
of the Americans at that notable repulse became afterwards a prominent politician, or, rather,
resumed his political career, and
was twice elected President of the
United States by the Democratic
party, which his course in office aided
to disintegrate. The contest during
the three times he was a candidate
was extremely bitter, and while
he was lauded by his friends as a
hero, patriot, and statesman, he was
denounced by his foes as an illiterate
ruffian, ignorant alike of military
science and state-craft. The
battle upon which his fame mainly
rested, was said to have been won
entirely by the folly of the British,
who stupidly marched upon impregnable
works, and were shot down
easily by expert marksmen intrenched
behind cotton-bales. This
last error is amusing, and nothing
will ever correct it. The embankment
behind which most of the
militia lay was formed of swamp-mud
mainly, the best material possible
for earthworks. A few cotton-bales
had been used at one point,
but one of them being fired, the
dense smoke made it an annoyance,
and it was speedily removed. That
my readers may comprehend the
affair, I give a brief account of the
operations leading up to the fight.</p>

<p>The proclamations of Lieutenant-colonel
Nichols at Pensacola, which,
in violation of Spanish neutrality, he
occupied with a British force, and
the attempt of the enemy to obtain
the aid and co-operation of Lafitte,
the head of the Baratarian outlaws,
had aroused the attention of Jackson,
who acted with his usual promptness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>
and decision, without awaiting orders from the War Department. He had been satisfied
of these designs before, through information obtained by means of his agents, and waited an
opportunity to strike a blow at the combined British and Spanish enemy. He knew that New
Orleans was to be the objective point of an expedition, and prepared for its defence. Recruiting
went on slowly; the Southern Indians were openly or covertly hostile; but the failure of a
naval and land attack on Fort Bowyer, repulsed with slaughter, and the loss of the flag-ship,
disengaged most of the savages from alliance with Nichols, and brought in large numbers of
volunteers. Jackson marched against Pensacola, where the British were intrenched, and proposed
to the governor to occupy two of the forts with American garrisons until the Spanish
government could send enough troops to make its neutrality respected. This the governor refused,
when Jackson at once attacked the town, and after storming a battery, most of the forts
were surrendered. Fort Barrancas was in the hands of the British, but before Jackson could
attack it, the enemy abandoned and blew it up, and with the Spanish governor and troops embarked
on the squadron and left the harbor. The American government gave a cold support,
almost amounting to censure, for this necessary and justifiable action; but public opinion in the
South and West sustained the commander of the Seventh Department.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent fs80">VILLERÉ’S MANSION.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Jackson, who had gone to Mobile before this to look after its defence, received from Governor
Claiborne the letter of Lafitte, giving the British propositions and their rejection, and
learned that the citizens of New Orleans, under the lead of Edward Livingston, had organized a
Defence Committee. He soon after left for New Orleans, where he arrived on the 2d of December.
He found the people alarmed and discordant—the masses blaming the Legislature, the
Legislature the governor, and the governor both. There was a lack of money, arms, ammunition,
and men. It is true there were two militia regiments and a slender volunteer battalion,
commanded by Major Planché, a brave creole officer;<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> but these were not sufficient to guard the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>
city, which contained a large amount of property, and had but meagre fortifications to protect its
approaches. Jackson went actively to work to improve the condition of things by strengthening
the forts, erecting new ones, obstructing the bayous, and establishing discipline.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="146" style="max-width: 62.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/146.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent fs80">“THE HERMITAGE,” JACKSON’S RESIDENCE, IN 1861.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>On the 9th of December the British squadron, having on board over seven thousand troops,
made their appearance and anchored near the entrance to Lake Borgne. Here they prepared to
land. They were not aware of the revelations of Lafitte, and hoped to take the place by surprise.
They soon learned their error. The late commodore (then lieutenant) Ap Catesby
Jones was in command of our flotilla, and had sent out two gun-boats, under command of
Lieutenant M’Keever and sailing-master Ulrick, to watch their approach. These reported the
fleet to Jones on the 10th, and Jones made for Pass Christian, where the astounded enemy saw
his flotilla at anchor on the 13th. As it was impossible to land troops under these circumstances,
Admiral Cochrane manned sixty barges, each armed with a carronade and filled with
men, to capture the tiny squadron, which was manned by one hundred and eighty-three men.
He succeeded in this, with the loss of three hundred killed and wounded, after an hour’s fight.
The American loss was only six killed and thirty-five wounded. This partly cleared the way
for the enemy, who also discovered the passage through the Bayou Bienvenu. On the 22d, as
many of the invaders as could find transportation embarked, and landing at the Fisherman’s Village,
at the mouth of the bayou, captured most of the picket-guard. The men taken so represented
the numbers of Jackson’s force that the invaders proceeded with more caution. They
moved slowly up the bayou, and at Villeré’s plantation surrounded the house, and took Major
Villeré, the commander of the pickets. He escaped, however, and carried the news to Jackson.</p>

<p>The American general in the mean while had not been idle. He had proclaimed martial
law in the city, brought the troops to a state of discipline, infused his heroic spirit into the
population, and sent messengers to Coffee, Carroll, and Thomas, urging them to move forward
their commands as soon as possible. On the 22d, Carroll’s troops of Tennessee levies, all skilled
riflemen, landed in New Orleans, and Coffee’s brigade of mounted rifles were encamped five
miles above the city. As soon as the news of the enemy’s presence was brought to Jackson he
determined to attack on the night of the 23d, both to check the enemy and to familiarize his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>
raw troops with their work. In the mean time the schooner <em>Carolina</em> was directed to drop down
the river in the darkness, and open fire on the enemy’s camp. That fire would drive them upon
the land-forces.</p>

<p>The affair was carefully managed and brilliantly carried out. The British were driven under
the levee, and the troops, excited and triumphant, returned to the city in perfect order and with
full confidence in their commander.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent fs80">JACKSON’S TOMB.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The events of the night had somewhat depressed the spirits of the enemy, and on Christmas-day,
which was cold and disagreeable, a gloom pervaded the British encampment. That day,
however, their spirits were lifted by the arrival of Sir Edward Pakenham, “the hero of Salamanca.”
Sir Edward was then in the prime of manhood, thirty-three years of age, brave, upright,
and honorable, and altogether undeserving of the obloquy that so long hung over his memory
as the reputed author of the asserted watchword—“beauty and booty.” He was among
old friends, most of the troops there having fought with him in the Spanish Peninsula. He
gave renewed life to the force. A battery of twelve and eighteen pounders and a howitzer was
planted so as to command the <em>Carolina</em>, and by means of hot shot, on the night of the 27th, she
was set on fire and destroyed. The <em>Louisiana</em>, the only remaining American vessel, escaped with
difficulty. Pakenham arranged his army in two columns, one under Keane and the other under
Gibbs, and moved forward, driving in the American outposts, and then encamped during the
night, where the riflemen annoyed them and prevented them from much sleep. The next morning
at dawn they moved to the attack, two to one in numbers and confident of success.
But they met with an unexpected resistance. The Baratarians and the crew of the <em>Carolina</em>
came up, and opened on them with twenty-four pounders, while the fire of the <em>Louisiana</em> from the
river enfiladed their line, doing terrible damage. On the right, Gibbs was not more successful,
though less terribly punished, and Pakenham was compelled to order a retreat, which on the left<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>
became disorderly. The comparative loss was remarkable—the Americans had seventeen
killed and wounded, and the British about one hundred and fifty—owing, doubtless, to the terrible
oblique fire of the <em>Louisiana</em>.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="148-1" style="max-width: 62.5em;">

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent fs80">PLAIN OF CHALMETTE.—BATTLE-GROUND.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>At the council of war called that evening, it was determined to land heavy siege guns from
the ships, to throw up redoubts, and prepare for a regular and concerted attack. During the
next few days this was carried out, and
several attempts were made to break the
American line. The fighting went on,
until Sir Edward, finding he could make
no impression, concluded to hazard all in
a stroke and carry the works by storm.</p>

</figure>

<p>Jackson during all this time was energetically
at work strengthening his position.
On the 4th of January his forces
were increased by the arrival of General
Thomas, with two thousand drafted men
from Kentucky, raw and undisciplined,
but for defensive work useful, being cool,
brave, and good marksmen. His intrenchments
were carried into the swamp
to prevent being flanked, and batteries
were placed in proper positions on the
lines on both sides of the river. Behind
the levee on Jourdan’s plantation, Commander
Patterson had placed a battery
of heavy guns from his schooner, and
manned them with seamen. This battery
commanding the front of the American
lines, drove the enemy from Chalmette’s
plantation to a point between Bienvenu
and De la Ronde’s.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span></p>

<p>On the 7th Major-general Lambert arrived with reinforcements, among the rest Sir Edward’s
own regiment, the 7th Fusileers, bringing his force up to ten thousand men, the very flower
of the British army. This was divided into three brigades, commanded by Generals Lambert,
Gibbs, and Keane, and on the following morning an attack was to be made on both sides of the
Mississippi. Thornton was to cross the river, and fall upon the Americans on that side before
dawn. His guns were to be the signal for the main attack. He was detained, however, in
the river, and the main attack was not made until daylight. Thornton was quite successful,
but retreated when he learned of the terrible repulse on the other side of the river.</p>

<p>The incidents of the main attack and the results will be found in the ballad.</p>

<p>The continually triumphant march of the American troops, under Scott, from Vera Cruz to
the City of Mexico, in spite of greater numbers of opposing soldiers, fighting for their own soil,
led many to undervalue the courage and endurance of the enemy. There never was a more
signal error. The Mexicans fought fiercely and well; they displayed daring and steadiness,
though they were not always able to stand before the bayonet, to whose uses they had not been
trained. Their signal defeats, occurring after obstinate and bloody resistance, were due to the
inefficiency of their general officers. Properly headed the Mexicans would make as fine soldiers
as any in the world.</p>

<p>Among the successive battles which marked the invasion, that of <em>El Molino del Rey</em> (The
King’s Mill) was one of the most spirit-stirring. One of the objects of attack consisted of a
range of buildings, five hundred feet in front and well fortified, known by the title of the poem.
On the left and farther off was the <em>Casamata</em> or arsenal, loop-holed, and surrounded by a
quadrangular field-work. Ravines and ditches, irregularities of ground, the position of the
Mexican troops, and their superiority in numbers, made the task exceedingly difficult. The attack
was begun at daylight. The enemy fought desperately and bitterly. Carrying the Mexican
guns in the open field, the Americans were driven back with great slaughter, but with
sufficient support retook them. At right and left the battle raged with a fury that showed the
courage and perseverance of both sides. The intrenchments were stormed, but not until after
a severe contest, and until house after house within the intrenchments had been broken into, the
Mexicans everywhere making a heroic resistance. The loss on both sides was heavy.</p>

The foundation is rather slender. Similar incidents have occurred in all wars, ancient and modern;

    <div class="verse indent0">From some thousands of muskets upon us fell fast,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">And to right and to left comrades they staggered and fell.</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">’Twas at Fredericksburg Heights, where we charged like such fools,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And learned by experience—that saddest of schools—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">An experience that brought us a fire-rain beneath—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Not to crack a hard nut, nor to try, with our teeth,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That I got this old sabre, and with it a scar,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">From a small pistol bullet, my beauty to mar;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And a narrow escape, for an inch t’other way,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And a narrow earth-jacket I’d worn the next day.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">I hated the enemy, then—no offence,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">No man can deny it; and there well intrenched</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">They awaited our coming, while none of us blenched,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Though we knew it was madness to charge up that hill,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That a child might have held had it courage and will.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">At the word we were off. It was glorious to see</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">How we marched to the charge with a step fast and free.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Flags flying, throats cheering, and every rank dressed</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To an inch in its straightness; when quick from the crest</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Opened loudly a hundred of cannon or more,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And the path of the balls was mapped out in our gore.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">We were brave, but some tasks are too fearful for man;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">We faltered, we turned—who could help it?—we ran.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">We tried it again with another rebuff;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And again, till we found we’d been hammered enough;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And then by the river at close of the day,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With the wounded, the men who came out of the fray—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And I tell you right glad to be certainly back—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Lay there on the ground. ’Twas a mournful bivouac,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With few of us sure as we talked o’er our loss</div>

  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">I strolled out to the picket—some thirty were there,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">When, an hour before midnight, there came quick and hard</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The trample of horse charging down on the guard;</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">And we met them—a squadron of dare-devils they—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But a sharp edge of bayonets kept them at bay,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">While we emptied some barrels, with never a corse,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Though we wounded one rider and crippled his horse.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">The rider pitched over; his comrades they heard</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His yell as he fell; but they turned and they spurred,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For by this time our camp was aroused and poured in,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And the visitors stayed not their laurels to win;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When what does this Hotspur but spring to his feet,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And, ready a regiment singly to meet,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Draw weapon, and there, right in front of our line,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To guard bring his sabre, and cross it with mine.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">’Twas a regular duel: our men gathered round;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Save the clash of the blades there was never a sound.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">’Twas cut, thrust, and parry—the fellow fenced well—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But at last on his shoulder a heavy blow fell,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And his sword dropped to earth—in an instant he felt</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With his left for a pistol that hung at his belt,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And he fired. O’er my temple the ball ploughed its track,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When I tripped him, and threw my bold youth on his back.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">I said as I held him, “This rage has no use;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">You’re two-thirds a lion and one-third a goose.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Do you want to fight armies! This passes a joke;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Surrender at once, or your throttle I’ll choke.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Stop the struggling, my madman, and tell us your choice—”</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">“I give my parole.” ’Twas a musical voice,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With a rather thin treble. Conceive my annoy</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When I found I had wasted my strength on a boy.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">’Twas a boy of sixteen, with his lip free of down,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Whose ball cut a groove ’twixt my temple and crown,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And who handled his sabre as deftly and keen</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As a master of fence. Yes, a boy of sixteen.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And I said, as I looked on him there where he stood,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Defiant, though conquered, and dauntless in mood,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">“You crow well, my cockerel, ere you have spurs;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Has your mother more such in that rare brood of hers?”</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Then he laughed, and his forefinger rose, as he said,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">“You carry the mark of my spur on your head—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Who’ll give me a drink?” as at word of command</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A dozen canteens were thrust ready to hand;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But ere he could choose, from his features there shrank</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The blood till he paled, then he staggered and sank.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">We raised him; I stooped there and pillowed his head</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">On my knee; and I shivered—I thought he was dead.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">But no, sir, he rallied. We bore him away,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When we crossed o’er the river, ere break of the day,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Where our surgeon soon healed up his wound, and I nursed</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The boy, and grew fond where I’d liked from the first,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Till, ready for prison, but hating confine,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He fled one dark night and got over the line;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And I never laid eyes on my bold shaver since.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That’s his sword, and a weapon would honor a prince.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">You smile at the story—I’ve seen you, but where?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">What name did you carry? “George Gaston!”—well—there!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Let me grapple your fist, boy? I’d never have known</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">You, with all of those whiskers. Why, how you have grown!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Twelve years! well, it <em>does</em> make a difference, I see,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In you, as it probably <em>has</em> made in me.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I can’t tell how glad I’m to see you at last.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Sit down; take a pipe; and we’ll talk o’er the past.</div>

<p>The incident which gave rise to the following poem happened about 1861, in Western Virginia,
somewhere in the Gauley River region. The story may be correct, or not. I do not
vouch for its accuracy. At all events, I have considered it to be <em>si non e vero, e ben trovato</em>, as
the Italian proverb has it. If it be not true, it is well feigned.</p>

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free

(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing

provided that:

<div style='margin-left:0.7em;'>
    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
        legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project

        &#8226; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

        receipt of the work.
    </div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
